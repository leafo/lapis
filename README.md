## Running Tests

Requires [Busted][2] and [MoonScript][1].

```bash
busted
```

If you want to run the tests that query PostgreSQL, you'll need to have
PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a database called `lapis_test`, ensure
the `postgres` user can be logged in with no password.

```bash
busted spec_postgres
```

Likewise, for MySQL tests, create a database called `lapis_test`. Ensure the
`root` user can be logged in with no password.

```bash
busted spec_mysql
```
