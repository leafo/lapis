# Testing

Lapis comes with utilities for handling two types of testing.

The first type is request mocking. Mocking a request simulates a HTTP request
to your application, bypassing any real HTTP requests and Nginx. The advantage
of this method is that it's faster and errors happen within the test process.

The second type uses the test server. The test server is a temporary Nginx
server spawned for the duration of your tests that allows you to issue full
HTTP requests. The advantage is you can test both Nginx configuration and your
application at the same time. It very closely resembles how your application
will run in production.

You are free to use any testing framework you like, but in these examples we'll
be using [Busted](http://olivinelabs.com/busted/).

## Mocking a Request

In order to test your application it should be a Lua module that can be
`require`d without any side effects. Ideally you'll have a separate file for
each application and you can get the application class just by loading the
module.

In these examples we'll define the application in the same file as the tests
for simplicity.

A request can be mocked using the `mock_request` function defined in
`lapis.spec.request`:

```lua
local mock_request = require("lapis.spec.request").mock_request

local status, body, headers = mock_request(app, url, options)
```

```moon
import mock_request from require "lapis.spec.request"

status, body, headers = mock_request(app, url, options)
```

For example, to test a basic application with
[Busted](http://olivinelabs.com/busted/) we could do:

```lua
local lapis = require("lapis.application")
local mock_request = require("lapis.spec.request").mock_request
local use_test_env = require("lapis.spec").use_test_env

local app = lapis.Application()

app:match("/hello", function(self)
  return "welcome to my page"
end)

describe("my application", function()
  it("should make a request", function()
    local status, body = mock_request(app, "/hello")

    assert.same(200, status)
    assert.truthy(body:match("welcome"))
  end)
end)

```

```moon
lapis = require "lapis"

import mock_request from require "lapis.spec.request"
import use_test_env from require "lapis.spec"

class App extends lapis.Application
  "/hello": => "welcome to my page"

describe "my application", ->
  use_test_env!

  it "should make a request", ->
    status, body = mock_request App, "/hello"

    assert.same 200, status
    assert.truthy body\match "welcome"
```

`mock_request` simulates an `ngx` variable from the Lua Nginx module and
executes the application. The `options` argument of `mock_request` can be used
to control the kind of request that is simulated. It takes the following
options in a table:

* `get` --  A table of GET parameters to add to the url
* `post` -- A table of POST parameters (sets default method to `"POST"`)
* `method` -- The HTTP method to use (defaults to `"GET"`)
* `headers` -- Additional HTTP request headers
* `host` -- The host the mocked server (defaults to `"localhost"`)
* `port` -- The port of the mocked server (defaults to `80`)
* `scheme` -- The scheme of the mocked server (defaults to `"http"`)
* `prev` -- A table of the response headers from a previous `mock_request`


If you want to simulate a series of requests that use persistant data like
cookies or sessions you can use the `prev` option in the table. It takes the
headers returned from a previous request.

```lua
local r1_status, r1_res, r1_headers = mock_request(my_app, "/first_url")
local r2_status, r2_res = mock_request(my_app, "/second_url", { prev = r1_headers })
```

```moon
r1_status, r1_res, r1_headers = mock_request MyApp!, "/first_url"
r2_status, r2_res = mock_request MyApp!, "/second_url", prev: r1_headers
```

### Using a `test` Environment

If you execute any queries during your tests without setting an environment
then they will run on the current environment. The default environment is
`development`, so this might not be ideal as it could mess up the state of your
database for development. It's suggested to make a `test` environment for
executing tests in with its own database connection.

You can add a configuration environment with separate database rules by editing
your <span class="for_moon">`config.moon`</span><span
class="for_lua">`config.lua`</span>:

> Read more about configurations on the [Configuration and
> Environments guide]($root/reference/configuration.html), and more about
> setting up a database on the [Database guide]($root/reference/configuration.html).

```lua
local config = require("lapis.config")

-- other configuration ...

config("test", {
  postgres = {
    backend = "pgmoon",
    database = "myapp_test"
  }
})

```

```moon
-- config.moon
config = require "lapis.config"

-- other configuration ...

config "test", ->
  postgres {
    backend: "pgmoon"
    database: "myapp_test"
  }
```

> Don't forget to initialize your test database by creating it and its schema
> before running the tests.

When executing your tests we can use the `use_test_env` function to ensure the
test block runs in the `test` environment. It is equivalent to adding a setup
and teardown function that sets and restores the environment.


```lua
local use_test_env = require("lapis.spec").use_test_env

describe("my site", function()
  use_test_env()

  -- write some tests that use the test environment
end)
```


```moon
import use_test_env from require "lapis.spec"

describe "my_site", ->
  use_test_env!

  -- write some tests that use the test environment
```

## Using the Test Server

While mocking a request is useful, it doesn't give you access to the entire
stack that your application uses. For that reason you can spawn up a *test*
server which you can issue real HTTP requests to.

The test server runs inside of the `test` environment (compared to
`development` and `production`). This enables you to have a separate database
connection for tests so you are free to delete and create rows in the database
without messing up your development state.

Additionally, when starting the test server, the local running Lapis
environment is also overridden to be `test`. Likewise, if you've set up a test
database for your test environment, you're free to run any queries without
interfering with development state.

Instead of using the `use_test_env` function from above, we'll call the
`use_test_server` function.


```lua
local use_test_server = require("lapis.spec").use_test_server

describe("my site", function()
  use_test_server()
  -- write some tests that use the server here
end)
```


```moon
import use_test_server from require "lapis.spec"

describe "my_site", ->
  use_test_server!

  -- write some tests that use the server here
```

The test server will either spawn a new Nginx if one isn't running, or it will
take over your development server until `close_test_server` is called. Taking
over the development server can be useful because the same stdout is used, so
any output from the server is written to a terminal you might already have
open.

### `request(path, options={})`

To make HTTP request to the test server you can use the helper function
`request` found in `"lapis.spec.server"`. For example we might write a test to
make sure `/` loads without errors:

```lua
local request = require("lapis.spec.server").request
local use_test_server = require("lapis.spec")

describe("my site", function()
  use_test_server()

  it("should load /", function()
    local status, body, headers = request("/")
    assert.same(200, status)
  end)
end)
```

```moon
import use_test_server from require "lapis.spec"
import request from require "lapis.spec.server"

describe "my_site", ->
  use_test_server!

  it "should load /", ->
    status, body, headers = request "/"
    assert.same 200, status

```

`path` is either a path or a full URL to request against the test server. If it
is a full URL then the hostname of the URL is extracted and inserted as the
`Host` header.

The `options` argument can be used to further configure the request. It
supports the following options in the table:

* `post` -- A table of POST parameters. Sets default method to `"POST"`,
  encodes the table as the body of the request and sets the `Content-type`
  header to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
* `method` -- The HTTP method to use (defaults to `"GET"`)
* `headers` -- Additional HTTP request headers
* `expect` -- What type of response to expect, currently only supports
  `"json"`. It will parse the body automatically into a Lua table or throw an
  error if the body is not valid JSON.
* `port` -- The port of the server, defaults to the randomly assigned port defined autmatically when running tests

The function has three return values: the status code as a number, the body of
the response and any response headers in a table.
