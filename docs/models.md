# Models

Lapis provides a `Model` base class for making Lua tables that can be
synchronized with a database row. The class is used to represent a single
database table, an instance of the class is used to represent a single row of
that table.

The most primitive model is a blank model:


```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

local Users = Model:extend("users")
```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.model"

class Users extends Model
```

<p class="for_lua">
The first argument to <code>extend</code> is the name of the table to associate
the model to.
</p>

<p class="for_moon">
The name of the class is used to determine the name of the table. In this case
the class name <code>Users</code> represents the table <code>users</code>. A
class name of <code>HelloWorlds</code> would result in the table name
<code>hello_worlds</code>. It is customary to make the class name plural.
</p>


Model instances will have a field for each column that has been fetched from
the database. You do not need to manually specify the names of the columns.  If
you have any relationships, though, you can specify them using the
[`relations` property](#describing-relationships).

## Primary Keys

By default all models expect the table to have a primary key called`"id"`. This
can be changed by setting the <span class="for_moon">`@primary_key`</span><span
class="for_lua">`self.primary_key`</span> class variable.


```lua
local Users = Model:extend("users", {
  primary_key = "login"
})
```

```moon
class Users extends Model
  @primary_key: "login"
```

If there are multiple primary keys then an array table can be used:

```lua
local Followings = Model:extend("followings", {
  primary_key = { "user_id", "followed_user_id" }
})
```

```moon
class Followings extends Model
  @primary_key: { "user_id", "followed_user_id" }
```

## Class Methods

Model class methods are used for fetching existing rows, creating new ones, or
fetching data about the underlying table.

For the following examples assume we have the following models:

```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

local Users = Model:extend("users")

local Tags = Model:extend("tags", {
  primary_key = {"user_id", "tag"}
})
```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.model"

class Users extends Model

class Tags extends Model
  @primary_key: {"user_id", "tag"}
```

### `find(...)`

The `find` class method fetches a single row from the table by some condition.
Pass the values of the primary keys you want to look up by in the order
specified by the `primary_keys` assigned in the Model's class.

> A model without user defined primary keys has the primary key of `id` by
> default. For those models, `find` would take one argument, the value of `id`.


```lua
local user = Users:find(23232)
local tag = Tags:find(1234, "programmer")
```

```moon
user = Users\find 23232
tag = Tags\find 1234, "programmer"
```

```sql
SELECT * from "users" where "id" = 23232 limit 1
SELECT * from "tags" where "user_id" = 1234 and "tag" = 'programmer' limit 1
```

`find` returns an instance of the model if it could be found, `nil` otherwise.

An alternate way of calling find is to pass a table as the first argument. The
table will be converted to a `WHERE` clause in the query:

```lua
local user = Users:find({ email = "person@example.com" })
```

```moon
user = Users\find email: "person@example.com"
```

```sql
SELECT * from "users" where "email" = 'person@example.com' limit 1
```

Like all database finders, you are free to use `db.raw` to embed raw SQL. For
example, you might perform a case insensitive email search like so:


```lua
local user = Users:find({ [db.raw("lower(email)")] = some_email:lower() })
```

```moon
user = Users\find [db.raw "lower(email)"]: some_email\lower!
```

```sql
SELECT * from "users" where lower(email) = 'person@example.com' limit 1
```

### `select(query, ...)`

When searching for multiple rows the `select` class method is used. It works
similarly to the [`select` function from the raw query
interface](database.html#query-interface-selectquery-params) except you specify
the part of the query after the list of columns to select.

```lua
local tags = Tags:select("where tag = ?", "merchant")
```

```moon
tags = Tags\select "where tag = ?", "merchant"
```

```sql
SELECT * from "tags" where tag = 'merchant'
```

Instead of a single instance, an array table of instances is returned. If there
are no matching rows an empty table is returned.

If you want to restrict which columns are selected you can pass in a table as
the last argument with the `fields` key set:

```lua
local tags = Tags:select("where tag = ?", "merchant", { fields = "created_at as c" })
```

```moon
tags = Tags\select "where tag = ?", "merchant", fields: "created_at as c"
```

```sql
SELECT created_at as c from "tags" where tag = 'merchant'
```

The `fields` option is inserted into the SQL statement as is, so do not use
untrusted strings otherwise you may be vulnerable to SQL injection. Use
[`db.escape_identifier`](database.html#query-interface-escape_identifierstr) to
escape column names.

You can use the `load` option to change what model each result of the query is
loaded as. By default it will convert each row to an instance of the model that
is calling the `select` method. Passing `false` to load will return the results
unaffected, as plain Lua tables.

### `find_all(primary_keys)`

If you want to find many rows by their primary key you can use the `find_all`
method. It takes an array table of primary keys. This method only works on
tables that have singular primary keys unless you explicitly pass a column to
search by.

```lua
local users = Users:find_all({ 1,2,3,4,5 })
```

```moon
users = Users\find_all { 1,2,3,4,5 }
```

```sql
SELECT * from "users" where "id" in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

If you need to find many rows for another column other than the primary key you
can pass in the optional second argument:


```lua
local users = UserProfile:find_all({ 1,2,3,4,5 }, "user_id")
```

```moon
users = UserProfile\find_all { 1,2,3,4,5 }, "user_id"
```

```sql
SELECT * from "UserProfile" where "user_id" in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

The second argument can also be a table of options. The following properties
are supported:

* `key` -- Specify the column name to find by, same effect as passing in a string as the second argument
* `fields` -- Comma separated list of column names to fetch instead of the default `*`
* `where` -- A table of additional `where` clauses for the query
* `clause` -- Additional SQL to append to query either as string, or array table of arguments to be passed to `db.interpolate_query`

For example:

```lua
local users = UserProfile:find_all({1,2,3,4}, {
  key = "user_id",
  fields = "user_id, twitter_account",
  where = {
    public = true
  }
})
```

```moon
users = UserProfile\find_all {1,2,3,4}, {
  key: "user_id"
  fields: "user_id, twitter_account"
  where: {
    public: true
  }
}
```

```sql
SELECT user_id, twitter_account from "things" where "user_id" in (1, 2, 3, 4) and "public" = TRUE
```

### `count(clause, ...)`

Counts the number of records in the table that match the clause.

```lua
local total = Users:count()
local count = Users:count("username like '%' || ? || '%'", "leafo")
```

```moon
total = Users\count!
count = Users\count "username like '%' || ? || '%'", "leafo"
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) "users"
SELECT COUNT(*) "users" where username like '%' || 'leafo' || '%'
```

### `create(values, create_opts=nil)`

The `create` class method is used to create new rows. It takes a table of
column values to create the row with. It returns an instance of the model. The
create query fetches the values of the primary keys and sets them on the
instance using the PostgreSQL `RETURNING` statement. This is useful for getting
the value of an auto-incrementing key from the insert statement.

> In MySQL the *last insert id* is used to get the id of the row since the
> `RETURNING` statement is not available.

```lua
local user = Users:create({
  login = "superuser",
  password = "1234"
})
```

```moon
user = Users\create {
  login: "superuser"
  password: "1234"
}
```

```sql
INSERT INTO "users" ("password", "login") VALUES ('1234', 'superuser') RETURNING "id"
```

If any of the column values are
[`db.raw`](database.html#query-interface-rawstr) then their computed values
will also be fetched using the `RETURN` clause of the `CREATE` statement. The
raw values are replaced by the values returned by the database.

For example, we might create a new row in a table with a `position` column set
to the next highest number:


```lua
local user = Users:create({
  position = db.raw("(select coalesce(max(position) + 1, 0) from users)")
})
```

```moon
user = Users\create {
  position: db.raw "(select coalesce(max(position) + 1, 0) from users)"
}
```

```sql
INSERT INTO "users" (position)
VALUES ((select coalesce(max(position) + 1, 0) from users))
RETURNING "id", "position"
```

> Since `RETURNING` is not available in MySQL, this functionality is PostgreSQL
> specific.

If your model has any [constraints](#constraints) they will be checked before trying to create
a new row. If a constraint fails then `nil` and the error message are returned
from the `create` function.

`create` can take an options table as a second argument. It supports the
following options:

* `returning` -- A string containing a list of columns to fetch along with the create statement using the `RETURNING` statement


### `columns()`

Returns all the columns on the table. Returns an array of tables that contain
column names and their types.

```lua
local cols = Users:columns()
```

```moon
cols = Users\columns!
```

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
  FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users'
```

The output might look like this:


```lua
{
  {
    data_type = "integer",
    column_name = "id"
  },
  {
    data_type = "text",
    column_name = "name"
  }
}
```

```moon
{
  {
    data_type: "integer",
    column_name: "id"
  }
  {
    data_type: "text",
    column_name: "name"
  }
}
```

> MySQL will return a slightly different format, but will contain the same information.

### `table_name()`

Returns the name of the table backed by the model.

```lua
Model:extend("users"):table_name() --> "users"
Model:extend("user_posts"):table_name() --> "user_posts"
```

```moon
(class Users extends Model)\table_name! --> "users"
(class UserPosts extends Model)\table_name! --> "user_posts"
```

<p class="for_moon">
This class method can be overidden to change what table a model uses:
</p>

```moon
class Users extends Model
  @table_name: => "active_users"
```

### `singular_name()`

Returns the singular name of the table.

```lua
Model:extend("users"):singular_name() --> "user"
Model:extend("user_posts"):singular_name() --> "user_post"
```

```moon
(class Users extends Model)\singular_name! --> "user"
(class UserPosts extends Model)\singular_name! --> "user_post"
```

The singular name is used internally by lapis when calculating what the name of
the field is when loading rows with `include_in`. It's also used when
determining the foreign key column name with a `has_one` or `has_many`
relation.

### `include_in(model_instances, column_name, opts={})`

Queries instances of the current model and loads them into an array of other
models. This is used to preload relations in a single query. Read more in
[Preloading Association](#preloading-associations)

### `paginated(query, ...)`

Similar to `select` but returns a `Paginator`. Read more in [Pagination](#pagination).

## Instance Methods

### `update(...)`

Instances of models have the `update` method for updating the row. The values
of the primary keys are used to uniquely identify the row for updating.

The first form of update takes variable arguments. A list of strings that
represent column names to be updated. The values of the columns are taken from
the current values in the instance.

```lua
local user = Users:find(1)
user.login = "uberuser"
user.email = "admin@example.com"
user:update("login", "email")
```

```moon
user = Users\find 1
user.login = "uberuser"
user.email = "admin@example.com"

user\update "login", "email"
```

```sql
UPDATE "users" SET "login" = 'uberuser', "email" = 'admin@example.com' WHERE "id" = 1
```

Alternatively we can pass a table as the first argument of `update`. The keys
of the table are the column names, and the values are the values to update the
columns with. The instance is also updated. We can rewrite the above example as:

```lua
local user = Users:find(1)
user:update({
  login = "uberuser",
  email = "admin@example.com",
})
```

```moon
user = Users\find 1
user\update {
  login: "uberuser"
  email: "admin@example.com"
}
```

```sql
UPDATE "users" SET "login" = 'uberuser', "email" = 'admin@example.com' WHERE "id" = 1
```

> The table argument can also take positional values, which are treated the
> same as the variable argument form.

If any of the updated values are generated from raw SQL via `db.raw`, then
those values will be replaced with values returning by the database using the
`RETURNING` clause similar to the [`create` class
method](#class-methods-createopts).

### `delete()`

Attempts to delete the row backed by the model instance based on the primary
key.

```lua
local user = Users:find(1)
user:delete()
```

```moon
user = Users\find 1
user\delete!
```

```sql
DELETE FROM "users" WHERE "id" = 1
```

`delete` will return `true` if the row was actually deleted. It's important to
check this value to avoid any race conditions when running code in response to a
delete.

Consider the following code:

```lua
local user = Users:find()
if user then
  user:delete()
  decrement_total_user_count()
end
```

```moon
user = Users\find 1
if user
  user\delete!
  decrement_total_user_count!
```

Due to the asynchronous nature of OpenResty, it's possible that if two requests
enter this block of code around the same time `delete` may end up getting called
twice. This isn't a problem by itself, but the `decrement_total_user_count`
function would get called twice and may invalidate whatever data it has.

### `refresh(...)`

Updates the values of the fields on the instance from the database.

If your model instance becomes out of date from an external change, use the
`refresh` method to re-fetch and re-populate its data.

```moon
class Posts extends Model
post = Posts\find 1
post\refresh!
```

```lua
local Posts = Model:extend("posts")
local post = Posts:find(1)
post:refresh()
```

```sql
SELECT * from "posts" where id = 1
```

By default all fields are refreshed. If you only want to refresh specific fields
then pass them in as arguments:


```moon
class Posts extends Model
post = Posts\find 1
post\refresh "color", "height"
```

```lua
local Posts = Model:extend("posts")
local post = Posts:find(1)
post:refresh("color", "height")
```

```sql
SELECT "color", "height" from "posts" where id = 1
```

## Timestamps

Because it's common to store creation and update times, models have
support for managing these columns automatically.

When creating your table make sure your table has the following columns:


```sql
CREATE TABLE ... (
  ...
  "created_at" timestamp without time zone NOT NULL,
  "updated_at" timestamp without time zone NOT NULL
)
```

You might create a table with timestamps using the schema syntax from Lapis
like this:

```lua
local schema = require "lapis.db.schema"

scehma.create_table("some_table", {
  -- ...
  {"created_at", schema.types.time},
  {"updated_at", schema.types.time}
  -- ...
})
```

```moon
import types, create_table from require "lapis.db.schema"

create_table "some_table", {
  -- ...
  {"created_at", types.time}
  {"updated_at", types.time}
  -- ...
}
```


You'll notice both columns are stored without timezone. Lapis stored
`created_at` and `updated_at` in UTC time.


Then define your model with the <span class="for_moon">`@timestamp` class
variable</span><span class="for_lua">`timestamp` property</span> set to
true:

```lua
local Users = Model:extend("users", {
  timestamp = true
})
```

```moon
class Users extends Model
  @timestamp: true
```

Whenever `create` and `update` are called the appropriate timestamp column will
also be set.

You can disable the timestamp from being updated on an `update` by passing a
final table argument setting <span class="for_moon">`timestamp:
false`</span><span class="for_lua">`timestamp = false`</span>:


```lua
local Users = Model:extend("users", {
  timestamp = true
})

local user = Users:find(1)

-- first form
user:update({ name = "hello world" }, { timestamp = false })


-- second form
user.name = "hello world"
user.age = 123
user:update("name", "age", { timestamp = false})
```

```moon
class Users extends Model
  @timestamp: true

user = Users\find 1

-- first form
user\update { name: "hello world" }, { timestamp: false }

-- second form
user.name = "hello world"
user.age = 123
user\update "name", "age", timestamp: false
```

## Preloading Associations

A common pitfall when using active record type systems is triggering many
queries inside of a loop. In order to avoid situations like this you should
load data for as many objects as possible in a single query before looping over
the data.

We'll need some models to demonstrate: (The columns are annotated in a comment
above the model).

```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

-- table with columns: id, name
local Users = Model:extend("users")

-- table with columns: id, user_id, text_content
local Posts = Model:extend("posts")
```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.model"

-- table with columns: id, name
class Users extends Model

-- table with columns: id, user_id, text_content
class Posts extends Model
```

Given all the posts, we want to find the user for each post. We use the
`include_in` class method to include instances of that model in the array of
model instances passed to it.

```lua
local posts = Posts:select() -- this gets all the posts
Users:include_in(posts, "user_id")

print(posts[1].user.name) -- print the fetched data
```

```moon
posts = Posts\select! -- this gets all the posts

Users\include_in posts, "user_id"

print posts[1].user.name -- print the fetched data
```

```sql
SELECT * from "posts"
SELECT * from "users" where "id" in (1,2,3,4,5,6)
```

Each post instance is mutated to have a `user` property assigned to it with an
instance of the `Users` model. The first argument of `include_in` is the array
table of model instances. The second argument is the column name of the foreign
key found in the array of model instances that maps to the primary key of the
class calling the `include_in`.

The name of the inserted property is derived from the name of the foreign key.
In this case, `user` was derived from the foreign key `user_id`. If we want to
manually specify the name we can do something like this:


```lua
Users:include_in(posts, "user_id", { as = "author" })
```

```moon
Users\include_in posts, "user_id", as: "author"
```

Now all the posts will contain a property named `author` with an instance of
the `Users` model.

Sometimes the relationship is flipped. Instead of the list of model instances
having the foreign key column, the model we want to include might have it. This
is common in one-to-one relationships.

Here's another set of example models:

```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

-- table with columns: id, name
local Users = Model:extend("users")

-- table with columns: user_id, twitter_account, facebook_username
local UserData = Model:extend("user_data")

```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.model"

-- columns: id, name
class Users extends Model

-- columns: user_id, twitter_account, facebook_username
class UserData extends Model
```

Now let's say we have a collection of users and we want to fetch the associated
user data:

```lua
local users = Users:select()
UserData:include_in(users, "user_id", { flip = true })

print(users[1].user_data.twitter_account)
```

```moon
users = Users\select!
UserData\include_in users, "user_id", flip: true

print users[1].user_data.twitter_account
```

```sql
SELECT * from "user_data" where "user_id" in (1,2,3,4,5,6)
```

In this example we set the `flip` option to true in the `include_in` method.
This causes the search to happen against our foreign key, and the ids to be
pulled from the `id` of the array of model instances.

Additionally, the derived property name that is injected into the model
instances is created from the name of the included table. In the example above
the `user_data` property contains the included model instances. (Had it been
plural the table name would have been made singular)

One last common scenario is preloading a one-to-many relationship. You can use
the `many` option to instruct `include_in` store many associated models for
each input model. For example, we might load all the posts for each user:


```lua
local users = Users:select()
Posts:include_in(users, "user_id", { flip = true, many = true })
```

```moon
users = Users\select!
Posts\include_in users, "user_id", flip: true, many: true
```

```sql
SELECT * from "posts" where "user_id" in (1,2,3,4,5,6)
```

Each `users` object will now have a `posts` field that is an array containing
all the associated posts that were found.


`include_in` supports the following options, including `as` and `flip` from above:

* `as` -- set the name of the property to store the associated model as
* `flip` -- set to `true` if the named column is located on the included model
* `where` -- a table of additional conditionals to limit the query by
* `fields` -- set the fields returned by each included model
* `many` -- set to true fetch many records for each input model instance instead of a single one

## Constraints

Often before we insert or update a row we want to check that some conditions
are met. In Lapis these are called constraints. For example let's say we have a
user model and users are not allowed to have the name "admin".

We might define it like this:

```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

local Users = Model:extend("users", {
  constraints = {
    name = function(self, value)
      if value:lower() == "admin" then
        return "User can not be named admin"
      end
    end
  }
})

assert(Users:create({
  name = "Admin"
}))

```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.models"

class Users extends Model
  @constraints: {
    name: (value) =>
      if value\lower! == "admin"
        "User can not be named admin"
  }


assert Users\create {
  name: "Admin"
}
```

The <span class="for_moon">`@constraints` class variable</span><span class="for_lua">`constraints` property</span> is a table that maps column name to a
function that should check if the constraint is broken. If anything truthy is
returned from the function then the update/insert fails, and that is returned
as the error message.

In the example above, the call to `assert` will fail with the error `"User can
not be named admin"`.

The constraint check function is passed 4 arguments. The model class, the value
of the column being checked, the name of the column being checked, and lastly
the object being checked. On insertion the object is the table passed to the
create method. On update the object is the instance of the model.

## Pagination

Using the `paginated` method on models we can easily paginate through a query
that might otherwise return many results. The arguments are the same as the
`select` method but instead of the result it returns a special `Paginator`
object.

For example, say we have the following table and model: (See [Database Schemas](database.html#database-schemas) for more information on creating tables.)

```lua
create_table("users", {
  { "id", types.serial },
  { "name", types.varchar },
  { "group_id", types.foreign_key },

  "PRIMARY KEY(id)"
})

local Users = Model:extend("users")
```


```moon
create_table "users", {
  { "id", types.serial }
  { "name", types.varchar }
  { "group_id", types.foreign_key }

  "PRIMARY KEY(id)"
}

class Users extends Model

```

We can create a paginator like so:

```lua
local paginated = Users:paginated("where group_id = ? order by name asc", 123)
```

```moon
paginated = Users\paginated [[where group_id = ? order by name asc]], 123
```

A paginator can be configured by passing a table as the last argument.
The following options are supported:

`per_page`: sets the number of items per page

```lua
local paginated2 = Users:paginated("where group_id = ?", 4, { per_page = 100 })
```

```moon
paginated2 = Users\paginated [[where group_id = ?]], 4, per_page: 100
```

`prepare_results`: a function that is passed the results of `get_page` and
`get_all` for processing before they are returned. This is useful for bundling
preloading information into the paginator. The prepare function takes 1
argument, the results, and it must return the results after they have been
processed:


```lua
local preloaded = Posts:paginated("where category = ?", "cats", {
  per_page = 10,
  prepare_results = function(posts)
    Users:include_in(posts, "user_id")
    return posts
  end
})
```

```moon
preloaded = Posts\paginated [[where category = ?]], "cats", {
  per_page: 10
  prepare_results: (posts) ->
    Users\include_in posts, "user_id"
    posts
}
```

Any additional options sent to `paginated` are passed directly to the
underlying `select` method call when a page is loaded. For example you can
provide a `fields` option in order to limit the fields returned by a page.

Whenever possible you should specify an `ORDER` clause in your paginated query,
as the database might returned unexpected results for each page.

The paginator has the following methods:

### `get_all()`

Gets all the items that the query can return, is the same as calling the
`select` method directly. Returns an array table of model instances.

```lua
local users = paginated:get_all()
```

```moon
users = paginated\get_all!
```

```sql
SELECT * from "users" where group_id = 123 order by name asc
```

### `get_page(page_num)`

Gets `page_num`th page, where pages are 1 indexed. The number of items per page
is controlled by the `per_page` option, and defaults to 10. Returns an array
table of model instances.

```lua
local page1 = paginated:get_page(1)
local page6 = paginated:get_page(6)
```

```moon
page1 = paginated\get_page 1
page6 = paginated\get_page 6
```

```sql
SELECT * from "users" where group_id = 123 order by name asc limit 10 offset 0
SELECT * from "users" where group_id = 123 order by name asc limit 10 offset 50
```

### `num_pages()`

Returns the total number of pages.

### `total_items()`

Gets the total number of items that can be returned. The paginator will parse
the query and remove all clauses except for the `WHERE` when issuing a `COUNT`.

```lua
local users = paginated:total_items()
```

```moon
users = paginated\total_items!
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as c from "users" where group_id = 123
```

### `each_page(starting_page=1)`

Returns an iterator function that can be used to iterate through each page of
the results. Useful for processing a large query without having the entire
result set loaded in memory at once.

```lua
for page_results, page_num in paginated:each_page() do
  print(page_results, page_num)
end
```

```moon
for page_results, page_num in paginated\each_page!
  print(page_results, page_num)
```

> Be careful modifying rows when iterating over each page, as your
> modifications might change the pagination order and you may process rows
> multiple times or none at all.

### `has_items()`

Checks to see if the pager returns at least 1 item. Returns a boolean. This is
more efficient than counting the items and checking for a number greater than 0
because the query generated by this function doesn't do any counting.

```lua
if pager:has_items() then
  -- ...
end
```

```moon
if pager\has_items!
  do_something!
```

```sql
SELECT 1 FROM "users" where group_id = 123 limit 1
```

## Describing Relationships

Often your models are connected to other models by use of a *foreign_key*. You
can describe the relationships between models using the `relations` class
property.

```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model
local Posts = Model:extend("posts", {
  relations = {
    {"users", belongs_to = "Users"},
    {"posts", has_many = "Tags"}
  }
})
```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.models"
class Posts extends Model
  @relations: {
    {"user", belongs_to: "Users"}
    {"posts", has_many: "Tags"}
  }
```

Relations will automatically add methods to models to make fetching the
associated model instances easy. For example the `belongs_to` relation from the
example above would make a `get_user` method:


```lua
local post = Posts:find(1)
local user = post:get_user()

-- calling again returns the cached value
local user = post:get_user()
```

```moon
post = Posts\find 1
user = post\get_user!

-- calling again returns the cached value
user = post\get_user!
```

```sql
SELECT * from "posts" where "id" = 1;
SELECT * from "users" where "id" = 123;
```

The following relations are available:

### `belongs_to`

A relation that fetches a single related model. The foreign key column used to
fetch the other model is located on the same table as the model.

The name of the relation is used to derive the name of the column used as the
foreign key in addition to the name of the method added to the model to fetch
the associated row.

A `belongs_to` relation named `user` would look for a column named `user_id` on
the current model. When the relation is fetched, it will be cached in a field
named `user` in the model.


```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

local Posts = Model:extend("posts", {
  relations = {
    {"user", belongs_to = "Users"}
  }
})
```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.models"

class Posts extends Model
  @relations: {
    {"user", belongs_to: "Users"}
  }
```

A `get_` method is added to the model to fetch the associated row:

```lua
local user = post:get_user()
```

```moon
user = post\get_user!
```

```sql
SELECT * from "users" where "user_id" = 123;
```

The relation definition can take an optional `key` option to override what
field is used on the current model to reference as the foreign key.

### `has_one`

A relation that fetches a single related model. Similar to `belongs_to`, but
the foreign key used to fetch the other model is located on the other table.


```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

local Users = Model:extend("users", {
  relations = {
    {"user_profile", has_one = "UserProfiles"}
  }
})
```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.models"
class Users extends Model
  @relations: {
    {"user_profile", has_one: "UserProfiles"}
  }
```

A `get_` method is added to the model to fetch the associated row:

```lua
local profile = user:get_user_profile()
```

```moon
profile = user\get_user_profile!
```

```sql
SELECT * from "user_profiles" where "user_id" = 123;
```

By default, the relation converts the name of the table to a foreign key column
name by making it singular and appending `_id`. The table `users` would convert
to `user_id`. Sometimes the calculated foreign key isn't correct, you can
provide a custom key with the `key` parameter to the relation:

```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

local Users = Model:extend("users", {
  relations = {
    {"user_profile", has_one = "UserProfiles", key = "owner_id"}
  }
})
```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.models"

class Users extends Model
  @relations: {
    {"user_profile", has_one: "UserProfiles", key: "owner_id"}
  }
```

```lua
local profile = user:get_user_profile()
```

```moon
profile = user\get_user_profile!
```

```sql
SELECT * from "user_profiles" where "owner_id" = 123;
```

### `has_many`

A one to many relation. It defines two methods, one that returns a [`Pager`
object](#pagination), and one that fetches all of the objects.

```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

local Users = Model:extend("users", {
  relations = {
    {"posts", has_many = "Posts"}
  }
})
```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.models"
class Users extends Model
  @relations: {
    {"posts", has_many: "Posts"}
  }
```

We can use the `get_` method to fetch all the associated records. If the
relation has already been fetched then it will return the cached value. The
cached value is stored in a field on the model that matches the name of the
relation.

```lua
local posts = user:get_posts()
```

```moon
posts = user\get_posts!
```

```sql
SELECT * from "posts" where "user_id" = 123
```

The `has_many` relation also creates a `get_X_paginated` method for getting a
pager that points to the related objects. This is useful if you know the
relation could include a large number of things and it does not make sense to
fetch them all at once.

Any arguments passed to the paginated getter are passed to the pager's
constructor, so you can specify things like `fields`, `prepare_results`, and
`per_page`:


```lua
local posts = user:get_posts_paginated({per_page = 20}):get_page(3)
```

```moon
posts = user\get_posts_paginated(per_page: 20)\get_page 3
```

```sql
SELECT * from "posts" where "user_id" = 123 LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40
```


The `has_many` relation supports a few more options:

* `key` -- the foreign key to search on, defaults to appending `_id` to the singular form of the table name, eg. `Users` → `user_id`
* `where` -- set additional constraints on the things returned, as a table
* `order` -- a SQL fragment as a string used to specify `order by` clause in the queries
* `as` -- specify the prefix of the generated methods (defaults to `get_NAME`)


Here's a more complex exmaple using some of the options:

```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

local Users = Model:extend("users", {
  relations = {
    {"authored_posts",
      has_many = "Posts",
      where = {deleted = false},
      order = "id desc",
      key = "poster_id"}
  }
})
```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.models"
class Users extends Model
  @relations: {
    {"authored_posts"
      has_many: "Posts"
      where: {deleted: false}
      order: "id desc"
      key: "poster_id"}
  }
```

```lua
local posts = user:get_authored_posts()
```

```moon
posts = user\get_authored_posts!
```

```sql
SELECT * from "posts" where "poster_id" = 123 and deleted = FALSE order by id desc
```

### `fetch`

A custom relation, provide a function to fetch the associated data. Result is cached.

```lua
local Model = require("lapis.db.model").Model

local Users = Model:extend("users", {
  relations = {
    {"recent_posts", fetch = function()
      -- fetch some data
    end}
  }
})
```

```moon
import Model from require "lapis.db.models"
class Users extends Model
  @relations: {
    {"recent_posts", fetch: =>
      -- fetch some data
    }
  }
```


## Enum

The `enum` function lets you create a special table that lets you convert
between integer constants and names. This is useful for created enumerations in
your database rows by using integers to represent a state.

```lua
local model = require("lapis.db.model")
local Model, enum = model.Model, model.enum

local Posts = Model:extend("posts")
Posts.statuses = enum {
  pending = 1,
  public = 2,
  private = 3,
  deleted = 4
}
```

```moon
import Model, enum from require "lapis.db.model"

class Posts extends Model
  @statuses: enum {
    pending: 1
    public: 2
    private: 3
    deleted: 4
  }
```

```lua
assert(Posts.statuses[1] == "pending")
assert(Posts.statuses[3] == "private")

assert(Posts.statuses.public == 2)
assert(Posts.statuses.deleted == 4)

assert(Posts.statuses:for_db("private") == 3)
assert(Posts.statuses:for_db(3) == 3)

assert(Posts.statuses:to_name(1) == "pending")
assert(Posts.statuses:to_name("pending") == "pending")

-- using to_name or for_db with undefined enum value throws error

Posts.statuses:to_name(232) -- erorr
Posts.statuses:for_db("hello") -- erorr
```

```moon
assert Posts.statuses[1] == "pending"
assert Posts.statuses[3] == "private"

assert Posts.statuses.public == 2
assert Posts.statuses.deleted == 4

assert Posts.statuses\for_db("private") == 3
assert Posts.statuses\for_db(3) == 3

assert Posts.statuses\to_name(1) == "pending"
assert Posts.statuses\to_name("pending") == "pending"

-- using to_name or for_db with undefined enum value throws error

Posts.statuses\to_name 232 -- erorr
Posts.statuses\for_db "hello" -- erorr

```
